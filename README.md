# Paws & Tails Dog Care - Website Build

This project is a complete, production-ready, Tailwind CSS-based website for a dog care business. It includes four pages generated from a single-category prompt: Home (index.html), About (about.html), Services (services.html), and Contact (contact.html). It also includes a README with setup and customization notes.

What you get
- 4 production-ready HTML pages with semantic HTML5 structure
- Fully responsive, mobile-first layout based on Tailwind CSS utilities
- A complete navigation system with internal linking between pages
- Category-appropriate typography and color palette tuned for a dog care brand
- Background image placeholders using the provided placeholder syntax
- Simple, accessible form on the Contact page
- Lightweight, dependency-free client-side script for basic interactions
- README with guidance on customization

Fonts and Design
- Primary heading font: Poppins
- Body content font: Open Sans
- Color palette: warm, friendly dog-care aesthetic (tailored per page)
- All images use descriptive alt text

How to run
1. Open index.html in your browser to view the Home page.
2. Navigate to About, Services, and Contact to see the full site.
3. Replace placeholder images with your own images or update placeholders to point to real assets if needed.

Customization tips
- Update text content to reflect your actual services and brand voice.
- Replace Hero background with a real dog-care themed image by changing the placeholder URL in the style tag where the hero section uses background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1677725049263-8f47f37eb76d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1OTU1NzMwNHww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080').
- If you add new pages, update the navigation in all pages to include links to the new page and ensure the number of unique pages matches the navigation links.
- Tailwind classes are used exclusively for styling; avoid adding new CSS blocks.

Category considerations
- This site is designed to be friendly and approachable for a dog care service. If you want a different vibe (more premium, more playful, more clinical), tell me and I can adjust the color palette, typography, and animation style accordingly.
